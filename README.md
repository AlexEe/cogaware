The aim of this project is two-fold:
- To create a tool that enables users to track their mind traps, thus making them more aware of their thinking patterns. The point of increased awareness is improving one's thinking patterns and, through that, one's life.
- To help those of my friends who are beginners in Python get some practical experience of working on a Python project. As a result there will be far more "obvious" comments in this codebase than will normally be expected.
